# Lesson 2, 3 and 4 Code Along

This week we are creating a web app to display Magic The Gathering (MTG) cards.

We will be utilizing everything we have learned so far and more to complete this project.

Please get familiar with the documentation for the API.

Create your new project call it whatever you want.

<ol>
    <li>Create a new react project</li>
    <li>Remove any bloat before you continue</li>
    <li>Install react-router-dom package</li>
    <li>Install any packages you want(sass, axios, tailwind etc.)</li>
</ol>

I'll make the following (everything inside the ./src folder):

```jsx
./utils/uris.js
./sass/main.scss
./components
./pages/Home.js
```
